# VCS Implementation

## Overview 
This project is a **Version Control System (VCS)** tailored for **MySQL databases**. Inspired by Git, it enables commit tracking, branching, and merging directly in a relational environment. It uses a **Python backend** with **MySQL Connector**, and a **Tkinter GUI frontend** for ease of use.
