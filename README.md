# VCS Implementation

## Overview 
This project is a **Version Control System (VCS)** tailored for **MySQL databases**. Inspired by Git, it enables commit tracking, branching, and merging directly in a relational environment. It uses a **Python backend** with **MySQL Connector**, and a **Tkinter GUI frontend** for ease of use.

## Features
- Create and manage **branches**  
- Make **commits** with messages and parent tracking  
- **Merge** branches with basic conflict detection  
- Retrieve **commit history**, **file contents**, and **branch info**  
- User-friendly **Tkinter-based GUI**
